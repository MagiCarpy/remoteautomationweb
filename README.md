    <h1>Remote Automation Website</h1>
    <p>Used to remotely control devices from the site</p>
    <b>Concept: </b>
    <p>
    Uses local Raspberry Pi that sends intervaled get requests to API of online website to check a toggle value. The status recieved signals a relay switch to turn a device on or off. (Probably not the best way to implement this, but circumvents dangers of port forwarding)
