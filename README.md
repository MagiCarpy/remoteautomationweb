    <h1>Remote Automation Website</h1>
    <p>Used to remotely control devices from the site</p>
    <h2>Concept: </h2>
    <p>
    Use Raspberry Pi that sends intervaled get requests 
    to API of the website hosted online to check change in value that turns a
    device on or off. (Probably not the best way to implement this, but avoids
    dangers of port forwarding)
