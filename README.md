## Remote Automation Website
Used to remotely control devices from the site
# Concept:
Uses local Raspberry Pi that sends intervaled get requests to API of online website to check a toggle value. The status recieved signals a relay switch to turn a device on or off.
      
Probably not the best way to implement this, but does circumvent the dangers of port forwarding. Security can be improved later (not the important part right now).

WORK IN PROGRESS
